Core experience (what the player does and feels in this world)
Avoiding an eccentric-human infested desolate cityscape, play as a zombie named Spud, trying to find the grave that feels just right.

Tone (the emotions the world conveys through mood and atmosphere)
The tone of this world is a dark and humorous one, taking place at night in a desolate cityscape. The humor in the game is enhanced by enemy interaction in the world, along with messages written on signs placed throughout the city. While the more dark side would be that Spud is the last zombie, and is being hunted down by the humans.
