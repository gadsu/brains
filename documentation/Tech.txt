 Nanites
 Machines manufactured by Zombinc to control the zombies created for their game. After the downfall of Zombinc and the release of the zombies into uncontrolled areas, the nanites spread to new hosts after zombies bite their victims. Once placed in a new host the nanites begin to multiply using the iron in the victim's blood.  These nanites cause advanced healing and allow zombies to survive well past the expected decay date. Eventually, the nanites use up all of the genetic material replicating themselves and mimicking the original material.
